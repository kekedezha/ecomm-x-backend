# Alvéole - Pain & Pâtisserie 🥐 (ecomm-x-backend REST API)

Born of air, time and craft - Alvéole is a celebration of the delicate precision behind every loaf, every layer, every crumb.

## Motivation 🤓

What started off as a general e-commerce REST API, hence the name ecomm-x-backend, transitioned into a REST API for a bakery 😋. I really had no idea where to take the e-commerce backend project and originally I wanted it to be a fitness brand due to my active lifestyle but figured that designing all the clothing and branding for the site would probably take longer than the coding itself. With this is mind I redirected my focus on another passion of mine which is bread and pastries. Recently, I feel like I have turned into my father where I need a piece of bread or pastry to go along with my cup of coffee in the mornings. I have also tried to pick up baking in 2025 and have a couple of bakes already under my belt. I thought let me make this e-comm REST API into a backend for an online bakery and thus 'Alvéole - Pain & Pâtisserie' was born!
